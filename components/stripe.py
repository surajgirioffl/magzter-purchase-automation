        # On payment page as well as on writing unique reference page, iframes are present.
        # Actually, unique reference page is loaded using AJAX on the same payment page.
        # So, if we try to get the iframe then we will get from the payment page.

        # # On payment page number of iframes are 7.

        # # So, total number of iframes on the unique reference page is 8.

        # If we reveal this DOM in dev tools, then it gets loaded and then javascript is applicable on it.
        # Note: Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree â€” this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which you can attach any element, in the same way as the normal DOM.
        # # Document.querySelectorAll() doesn't find the elements in our shadow DOM: they are effectively hidden from JavaScript in the page
